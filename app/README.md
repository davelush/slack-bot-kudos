#DB Migrations

These scripts are intend for upgrades and downgrades of a Postgres DB using [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate). 
I've included a binary for the [4.2.5 darwin-amd64](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/releases/tag/v4.2.5) version
for convenience. Others can be downloaded at the link

An example of how to run this at the command line is

```bash
blah blah blah
```
