# Serverless Framework Python REST API on AWS

This template demonstrates how to make a simple REST API with Python running on AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the Serverless Framework v1.

This template does not include any kind of persistence (database). For a more advanced examples check out the [examples repo](https://github.com/serverless/examples/) which includes DynamoDB, Mongo, Fauna and other examples.

## Setup

Run this command to initialize a new project in a new working directory.

`sls init aws-python-rest-api`

## Usage

**Deploy**

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard which includes advanced features like CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

```
$ serverless login
$ serverless deploy
```

To deploy without the dashboard you will need to remove `org` and `app` fields from the `serverless.yml`, and you wonâ€™t have to run `sls login` before deploying.

**Invoke the function locally.**

```
serverless invoke local --function hello
```

**Invoke the function**

```
curl https://xxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/
```
